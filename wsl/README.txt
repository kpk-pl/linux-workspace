Link the .dircolors .vim and .vimrc files

For the terminal colors, use the following mapping from the solarized colorsheme
https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/60da1u/solarized_colors_for_vim_in_bash_on_windows_works/

Color #	Solarized colors
0	base02
1	blue
2	green
3	cyan
4	red
5	magenta
6	yellow
7	base2
8	base03
9	base0
10	base01
11	base1
12	orange
13	violet
14	base00
15	base3

Map the solarized colors to XTERM/HEX colors
Probably the base03 and base02 are mixed up, because vim recognizes it that way somehow
